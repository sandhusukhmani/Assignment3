# Assignment 3

For this assignment, I will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in Data Analytics!

I performed exploratory data analysis and looked at  three hypotheses based on the dataset. 
These include:
- Association between class of passenger and survival rate
- Association between gender and survival rate 
- Association between age and survival rate


### Folder Structure

The folder structure of the repo is as follows :

```
├── src                     # Source files (your python code)
├── data                    # Data related to the project (titanic.csv)
├── result                  # Result of the project (e.g., plots, reports)
└── doc                     # Documentation files (additional documentations)
